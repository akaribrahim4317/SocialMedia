SocialMedia App

The socialMedia app is a simple app for junior mobile application developers. 
It is designed for beginners who have little experience with react native components and react navigation. 

Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the Xcode and Android Emulator install on your Macbook (for Windows users only Android Studio is necessery)
2. Download the SocialMedia project file from the repository.
3. Install Cocoapods.(Only necessery for MAC users)
4. Run pod install so you can install the dependencies in your project (Only necessery for MAC users)
5. Open the project files in Xcode and Android Studio 
6. Review the code and make sure you understand what it does.

Once you are comfortable with the basic components and navigation, you can modify the code.
